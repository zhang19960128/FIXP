# FIX polarization calculations. Becareful about the material since the Zeller tunning limit is very each to reach. 
# Read David Vanderbilt's Original PRL paper. (Physical Review Letter 96,056401, PhysRevLett.89.117602)
# Generally, large bandgap material is better for performing such calculations.
